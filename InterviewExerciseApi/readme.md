# Great State interview exercise

## Overview

This code is simulating a bank of three lifts in a hotel lobby.

There are two public APIs which can be called to interact with the lift system.

## The approach

The approach is deliberately incomplete and may be sub-optimal.

There are two public API endpoints, one for calling a lift, the other for getting the status of all lifts.

The lift controller contains the business logic for attempting to summon the closest lift.

All persistence happens in-memory - no database has been implemented.

The lifts themselves encapsulate some of their logic inside a state machine.

The state machine configuration determines which 'state' the lift transitions into (e.g. stopped, moving) and 
what triggers the state transition (e.g. lift has been called, lift has arrived).

## Your tasks

1. Talk us through a code review of the 'Call()' method in LiftController.cs. Some areas to think about:
    - Is it readable?
    - Are there any obvious code smells?
    - How else would you improve it?
    
2. Talk us through some examples of unit tests you would write for the 'Call()' method mentioned in the previous question?

3. Implement the unit tests discussed in the previous question.

4. Identify the problem causing lifts to malfunction after they have been called once, and fix it.

5. Implement a new type of ILift that instantly transports to the correct floor, and inject it into the LiftController.

6. Implement a front end that displays the call buttons and the current lift statuses.
